# Healthcare Track Data Analysis

Inspiration: The percentage of uninsured population differs significantly by states.

What it does: Our project makes two hypotheses and found that college education and population wealth are two factors affecting uninsured rate.

How we built it: We built the the linear regression models with R and made visualizations with Tableau.

Challenges we ran into: Finding out what could possibly be the predictor of uninsured rate was challenging.

Accomplishments that we're proud of: Cooperated as a group efficiently and communicated respectfully with each other throught the entire project.

What we learned: We learned methods of extracting data from a dataset, analyzing the underlying relationships and presenting what we found through visualization.

What's next for Healthcare Data Analysis: People's awareness of the importance of insurance needs to be strengthened.
