We mainly used R to analyze the data in UninsuredState.xlsx and used Tableau to help visualize our result. Feel free to see our slides for the project presentation. Our presentation video is available at ([link](https://devpost.com/software/healthcare-data-analysis))

Dataset used:

State, County, and Local Estimates of the Uninsured Population: Prevalence and Key Demographic Features ([link](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/state-county-local-estimates-uninsured-population-prevalence-key-demographic-features))

This dataset was supplied by Elliot Inman from SAS Institute and it contains the state and local estimates of the Uninsured Population in the U.S. using the census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey. It includes state-level, [PUMA](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/pumas.html)-level, and county-level ASPE uninsured estimates.
