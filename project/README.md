# Project Overview

Once you've settled on a dataset, you can start your projects! You can use whatever statistical tools that suit your needs. But if you're new, or just wanting to explore some new tools, here are a couple that you can use/download!

### Dataset used:

### State, County, and Local Estimates of the Uninsured Population: Prevalence and Key Demographic Features ([link](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/state-county-local-estimates-uninsured-population-prevalence-key-demographic-features))
This dataset was supplied by Elliot Inman from SAS Institute and it contains the state and local estimates of the Uninsured Population in the U.S. using the census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey. It includes state-level, [PUMA](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/pumas.html)-level, and county-level ASPE uninsured estimates.
